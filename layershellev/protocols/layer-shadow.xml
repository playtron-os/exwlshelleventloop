  <description summary="request shadow rendering for layer surfaces">
    This protocol provides a way for clients to request that the compositor
    render a shadow behind their layer shell surfaces.

    This is useful for floating panels, notifications, and other overlay
    elements that want a drop shadow effect without having to render it
    themselves.
