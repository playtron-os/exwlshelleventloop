  <description summary="communicate corner radius of layer surfaces">
    This protocol provides a way for clients to communicate the
    corner radius of their layer shell surfaces, should they use rounded corners.

    This hint can then be used by the compositor to draw fitting blur outlines
    or prevent overdrawing of other server-side drawn interfaces.

      Manager for creating corner-radius objects for surfaces.
